Create Ethereum Proxy of ICP
====================================================================================================

There is an example that shows how to create a contract which calls a bridge canister 
(smart contract).  The bridge cannister allows an ICP cannister to call an ethereum solidity 
contract.

This is the flow;

    ICP canister example ==> calls ICP bridge cannister ==> calls Ethereum smart contract
    
The example was done by Steve and is hosted here:

You need to firt make sure your rust and dependencies are up to date:


    (i) rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown 
    
    (ii) cargo install candid-extractor
    
    (iii) Make sure dfx is not running:
    
            dfx stop
            
        If it complains processes are still running:
        
            dfx killall
            
    (iv) Make sure typescript is installed globally:  npm install -g typescript

Then there are two ways of running the example.  One way is using the curl command which runs
a shell script that does everything. The other way is cloning manually.

    (vii) Curl way
    
        This command is a shell script which tries to automate creating a new project. It clones from
        github and does stuff like start dfx and deploy the contracts.
        
        Run this command:
        
            bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephen-Kimoi/icp-evm-rust-bridge/main/install_and_deploy.sh)" -- utu-trust-utt-proxy-icp
            
        Look carefully at the terminal.  The script currently does not stop if there is an error. If
        there is an error you may want to be doing it the manual way below.
        
    (viii) Manual way
    
            git clone https://github.com/Stephen-Kimoi/icp-evm-rust-bridge.git
            
            cd icp-evm-rust-bridge
            
            npm install
            
            dfx start
            
            dfx deps pull
            
            dfx deps init evm_rpc --argument '(record { nodesInSubnet = 28 })'
    
            dfx deps deploy
            
            dfx deploy
        
        If you have a problem with it deploying a canister and not being able to create it because
        it is corrupt:
        
            dfx canister stop 7hfb6-caaaa-aaaar-qadga-cai

            dfx canister delete 7hfb6-caaaa-aaaar-qadga-cai
            
            dfx deploy
